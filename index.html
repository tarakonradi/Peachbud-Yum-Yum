					<li>Pick out your flight</li>
					<li>Call the airline to ensure there's not more than 2 pets on the flight already (most airlines only allow 2 per flight-check with them to be sure)</li>
					<li>Once you have confirmed there's less than two pets, book your flight and then call them back to confirm you are brining your pet in the cabin</li>
					<li>If there's more than two you just have to be the first to check in at the airport. You cannot check in prior to the airport because you have a pet. At the airport you will check in and then be re-directed to a different line to pay the pet fee</li>
					<li>Make sure you have a good carrier for your pet and be prepared to have your little love bug under the seat during take-off and landing</li>
					<li>After checking in and paying the pet fee head to the plane, board, respect others might not like your furry guy, and enjoy the flight</li>
